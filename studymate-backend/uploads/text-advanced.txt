The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of life. All living organisms are made up of cells. Some organisms like Amoeba are unicellular, while plants and animals are multicellular. Cells have different shapes and sizes depending on their function. Every cell has three main parts:
Cell membrane – a protective, selectively permeable boundary controlling movement of substances.
Cytoplasm – a jelly-like substance containing organelles like mitochondria, ribosomes, etc.
Nucleus – the control center of the cell containing genetic material (DNA).
Plant cells have additional structures like a cell wall, large vacuole, and chloroplasts, which are absent in animal cells. Cells divide to form new cells and help in growth and repair of the body.
